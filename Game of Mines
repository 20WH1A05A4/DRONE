PROBLEM:
The project Game of Mines is will be useful for defense team. The one of the main problems in the defense management will be due to landmines which were
buried at the time of wars. Those were left over in ground since many years. And it will be very dangerous for the army to reach places and they are even 
losing their lives.The consequences of this problem can be devastating. Landmines can cause serious injury or death to those who accidentally trigger
them, and can also limit access to land and resources, hindering economic development andrecovery efforts. Military personnel are particularly at risk, 
as they may be required to operate in areas that are known or suspected to contain landmines.

SOLUTION:
The army are working against the clock to save the lives of people.The metal detector to drone project is an innovative and exciting endeavor that seeks to
combine two technologies to create a new solution for detecting metal objects in difficult-to-reach areas. This project aims to create a drone that is 
equipped with a metal detector. By doing so, the drone will be able to quickly and efficiently scan large areas and detect any metal objects that may be
buried or hidden. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries and the effectiveness of search and rescue missions.
It gives us 3D view of the particular area where we can see the buried landmines in the connected software. By sending the axis points with help of 
GPS we can easily trace them out. It will be very much useful for the army to rescue themselves from landmines. Overall, the metal detector drone has the 
potential to revolutionize various industries and improve the efficiency and safety of many tasks that involve the detection of buried metal objects.
