1.Problem Statement:
      •	Delivering the medicines or organs on time.We see many people loosing their lives as the medicines are not delivered on time this is because 
      of road delivery and traffic on roads.
      •	Fire men loosing  their lives without proper information.We have experienced a case in Hyderabad that a firemen lost his life as he don't know 
      where people were struck so attempted to go inside and  lost their life.
      •	The requirements are not reaching people near disaster areas.We see like in disaster areas people don't have proper food or any requirements the 
      rescue team has overcame it by delivering them by helicopter but it's very expensive for the government.
2.Validation of the problem through data collection and analysis:
      •	Suppose a person had an accident he needs blood immediately but we need to get the blood from blood banks which is far away in this situation if 
      we delivery blood by road it takes lot of time if the roads are blocked it will be a disturbance for the common people who are traveling.
      •	Many fire men are not having the proper information about the fire spot it is difficult for them to rescue the people who got struck.
      •	During Kerala floods the rescue team delivered the food and requirements of the people there with help of helicopter but through helicopter it was
      too expensive and they were not able deliver each and every place
3.Idea and Concept:
      •	To decrease in delay of organs or medicines We came with the solution that is delivering all the medical requirements which will be sustaining in
      certain temperature and not available in nearby places through drone. Where there will be no traffic created and fast supply of the goods.  
      •	We will be attaching a fire extinguisher to the drone which will be spraying in the smaller areas and enter the fire spot and it will be attached 
      with the thermal camera which gives the information about the people who got struck and also a gas sensor where we get information about the different 
      gases released due to fire accidents.
      •	The parachute box is the good way to delivery the requirements to the people at disaster times. As the road ways will not be so clear to travel and
      it is difficult to supply. Airways is the better option for the supply to decrease the burden for the government we can supply through drones. And 
      we attach a loud speaker to that for giving the instructions for the people
4.Project description and High level design:
      • We have designed a low cost multi-purpose drone with an payload capacity of 20kg with changeable modes like fridge, air tight box and food dropper etc.…
      It is loaded with inbuilt gas sensor, ultrasonic sensor, communication module, ultra-wide and infrared thermal cameras etc. and have Ground Control Stations 
      (GCS) and mobile application for external use which can provide assistance in medical emergencies, search and rescue operations
5.Project Benefits:
      • Multiple purpose • Multi-Tasking • Mini temperature adjustable fridge. •Air lock box • Rescue drone works without internet to transfer the data from
      speaker, gas sensor and fire sensor •Gas sensor in drone 
      Coming to our product feature and benefits, it has changeable mods and light weight. It is weather proof in nature
